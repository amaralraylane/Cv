        <h1>Raylane Livingston</h1>
        <p><em>Portuguese and English Speaker <strong>Nanny</strong>.</em></p>
        <p>I have over 5 years of experience with kids as a nanny, babysitter and teacher. I spent the last 2 years as an au pair (nanny live in) for an awesome family and the kids were 0-3 years old, but I have experience with all ages.
          Arts and crafts, singing, dancing, cooking, puzzles, playgrounds, farms and much more are part of my day while taking care of kids. It's always a lot of fun!
          I am great at organizing kids toys/clothes/room and also at planning/cooking their meals.
          First Aid and CPR certified, own transportation and references available.</p>
